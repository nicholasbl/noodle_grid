- Voltage Scale
- Represent line loading %. Not sure how to do this. We could:
    - Add an ability to toggle between Voltage and LL
    - Add an ability to toggle between coloring by phase and LL
    - Let LL be a gradient on the phase color
    - Or ???
- Add the ability to probe and tooltip
  - generate graphs on PV panels, batteries, and loads
  - basic metadata on buses and lines
