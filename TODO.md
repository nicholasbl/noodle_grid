- Represent line loading %. Not sure how to do this. We could:
    - Add an ability to toggle between Voltage and LL
    - Add an ability to toggle between coloring by phase and LL
    - Let LL be a gradient on the phase color
    - Or ???
- Show open switches (annotation nodes)
- Show line node position switches
- Custom app for deployment
- Show probed-item location
- Can we do a look-at and then probe with a click?
- Documentation
- Batteries versus PV
- Toggle reactive - real flow
- Skybox for VP app
- Color based on voltage?
- Background options? have to be in immersive mode
- Check power flow direction
- battery charging and discharging
