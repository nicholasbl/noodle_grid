- Represent line loading %. Not sure how to do this. We could:
    - Add an ability to toggle between Voltage and LL
    - Add an ability to toggle between coloring by phase and LL
    - Let LL be a gradient on the phase color
    - Or ???
- Add the ability to probe and tooltip
  - generate graphs on PV panels, batteries, and loads
  - basic metadata on buses and lines
- Would be nice to hide or other make some lines/branches transparent
- Show open switches (annotation nodes)
- Show line node position switches
- Custom app for deployment
- Show probed-item location
- Documentation
- Batteries versus PV
- Toggle reactive - real flow
- Skybox for VP app
- Remove probes. Possible two charts per probe?
