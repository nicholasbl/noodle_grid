- Represent line loading %. Not sure how to do this. We could:
    - Add an ability to toggle between Voltage and LL
    - Add an ability to toggle between coloring by phase and LL
    - Let LL be a gradient on the phase color
    - Or ???
- Add the ability to probe and tooltip
  - generate graphs on PV panels, batteries, and loads
  - basic metadata on buses and lines
- Color the P/Q arrows to indicate if they are travel toward/away from the feeder head
- Would be nice to hide or other make some lines/branches transparent
- Now that we're in a headset, it might make sense to arrange scenarios around us, instead of just switching between then like we do in the cave.
- Also, the PV Q looks flat, I'm wondering that is a sign issue.
- Show open switches (annotation nodes)
- SHow line node position switches
